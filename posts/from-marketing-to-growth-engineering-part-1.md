What a month it‚Äôs has been!

1-month ago I started as a student at LambdaSchool. January, 7th 2019 to be exact.

I‚Äôve joined LambdaSchool‚Äôs first ever European cohort ‚Äî WEB EU1.

It‚Äôs been an amazing experience so far! If you had told me where I would be back when I started, I would not have believed you. It‚Äôs been an intense and rewarding first month.

### Let‚Äôs get back a little bit and give you a bit of context.

I‚Äôm Maxime. I launched [Croissant](https://croissant.io/) in 2018. We are an on-demand growth team for startups. Our team now consists of four people working remotely: 1 designer, 2 engineers & I ‚Äî marketing/product/growth.

I was lucky enough to have worked for [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) before and did [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) with them back in 2014. Since then, it‚Äôs been quite a chaotic ride. That‚Äôs life I guess.

2018 wasn‚Äôt great either. I struggled and that affected the business. But, we have a great & supportive team. Thanks again Valentin, Alex & Maxim!

*In this series of post, I will do my best to share my experience moving from Marketing to Growth Engineering by attending LambdaSchool.*

## What‚Äôs Growth Engineering?

*‚ÄúGrowth Engineering = Growth + Engineering*

Growth is a function in an organization that owns parts of the funnel helping the company grow. It first appeared in consumer startups. We can now find more and more B2B startups that are starting to build their own growth team. Hubspot being the perfect example.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4452/1*xiP7zpMuDEKAK4QkaV2NQQ.png)

Growth Teams are responsible for user acquisition, user onboarding, features improvement, tooling, analytics andreferrals. They are cross-functional ‚Äî engineers, designers & product managers ‚Äî and often work in squads. They might have a data-scientist, but this position is often ad-hoc.

Growth Engineering is the sub-part of Growth responsible for technically implementing growth experiments on user acquisition (SEO / Paid), conversion (A/B Testing, Onboarding) and product improvements. They are also building internal tooling to support the growth process.

## **What does a Growth Engineer look like and who is hiring?**

*const keyword = ‚Äòhybrid‚Äô*

Growth Engineers are engineers with growth chops. Foremost, they are engineers. It took me a while to come to peace with this. Now that I have, I‚Äôm doing LambdaSchool :)

Growth Engineers are full-stack engineers who were founders before or are wannabe founder. They seek business impact when building software.

More companies are building Growth Team and some great ones are currently hiring Growth Engineers.

Now, onto LambdaSchool and how I‚Äôve decided to join the program as a way to become a growth engineer.

## Finding about LambdaSchool

*yes, twitter can be a great acquisition channel*

I first heard of LambdaSchool on Twitter in early 2018. Since then, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve spent a week without seeing something related to LambdaSchool. PS ‚Äî the tweets below are similar to the tweets I saw.

This is an excellent strategy for a few reasons:

* **Awareness:** I probably read a tweet before 2018, but never actually noticed it. I finally read one and I‚Äôm glad I did. The tweets were often not related to LambdaSchool.

and things I could relate to‚Ä¶

 <iframe src="https://medium.com/media/38afeef9a545295e15428a857a8b40e4" frameborder=0></iframe>

* **Engagement:** After learning about Lambda, I saw a few tweets that gave me enough value and some ‚Äúoh wow‚Äù effect to be honest so I wanted to check them out. I went to [LambdaSchool.com](https://lambdaschool.com/) and went through it.

 <iframe src="https://medium.com/media/ece493c9f3cedfaccd6e9333c422f04c" frameborder=0></iframe>

* **Exploration: **Over time, I saw how many new people were joining the program. How they enjoyed it, and how much some of their students were actually getting hired for. It wasn‚Äôt just LambdaSchool saying how great they were, but actual students sharing their experience.

 <iframe src="https://medium.com/media/c0632905bf550ad01b66c19a42951008" frameborder=0></iframe>

 <iframe src="https://medium.com/media/460c14e6a35a82425baf48384e97ca72" frameborder=0></iframe>

* **Conversion: **I finally decided to apply for two reasons: 1. They were opening a full-time cohort in Europe. 2. They care. I witnessed multiple times how they listened to the feedback from their students and implemented them in record time. I knew it was a special place and I wanted to be part of it.

 <iframe src="https://medium.com/media/1b0c79ebc870a1cbef5132e50598196e" frameborder=0></iframe>

 <iframe src="https://medium.com/media/9c7853fed5383b0a9569e99a1214f0fc" frameborder=0></iframe>

To make sure I wasn‚Äôt an outlier, I asked my fellow students how they found out about LambdaSchool. We are a small cohort, about 20 people. 15 answered.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4452/1*sz9W4Oe5jt8G5bOdB825Og.png)

As a marketer, I couldn‚Äôt be happier to see these results. Most of my fellow students have heard of LambdaSchool from word of mouth or ‚Äúfree‚Äù channels. This means there is a huge untapped growth opportunity.

LambdaSchool has come to the same conclusion.

They are starting to test a few paid channels & other types of content. PS ‚Äî I don‚Äôt have more information on this than what is publicly available.

## **Applying & getting into LambdaSchool**

excitement, fear, excitement

I‚Äôve tried to learn to code several times over the past few years, but never prioritized for it. Thus, I never made any substantial progress. That‚Äôs what is interesting with programs like LambdaSchool. It‚Äôs a commitment to learning how to code + a safety net of people that are here to help you.

I‚Äôve applied to LambdaSchool twice. Once for the US program. Once for the EU program right before they closed down their recruitment process. Thanks for that Karen :)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2364/1*kpBDFDP6dwKGK9Z3YBnarg.png)

Once I had applied for the EU cohort. I knew I had a better shot at it. Then, I got an email to schedule an interview.

I was in the south of France on holidays during that time. Internet was not great, but the interview went well :) I spent the next 48 hours doing the pre-course work and completed the LambdaSchool code challenge.

A few days later, I got an exciting news in my inbox. I was in üéâ

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4272/1*RHAMYx7IAaTJZc9Muappng.png)

I would be starting on Monday, January 7th 2019 and start my journey to become a growth engineer.

## 5 weeks into LambdaSchool

*it‚Äôs just the beginning*

LambdaSchool is a 9 months long program divided into four parts:

* *3 months of Full Stack Web Development Core: *The 3 months (or 15 weeks) are divided into 3 parts of 5 weeks each with 4 weeks of class + 1 [build week](https://twitter.com/Austen/status/1069584101815013377) where we learn about Git, HTML, CSS, LESS, JavaScript, React, HTTP, Ajax, Redux, Node.js, Express.js, SQL, Authentification, Testing.

* *5 weeks of Lambda Labs: A 5-week long project where we build a full-blown SaaS app in a group of 3‚Äì4 people.*

* *3 Months of Computer Science: *In the computer science curriculum, we learn about Python, Django, Algorithms, Data Structures, Graphs, C, Theory of Computation, Hash Tables, Computer Architecture, Web Server.

* *2 months of Lambda Next: Not sure yet how this works.*

Right now ‚Äî I‚Äôm 5 weeks in which means I‚Äôve learned about Git, HTML, CSS, LESS & JavaScript. That I‚Äôve just finished my first build week where I built a new homepage for [croissant.io](https://croissant.io). If you want to see how it wents, I actually [streamed the whole thing on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/maximesalomon/videos) :)

Once I was done with it. I played around with React, created an API with Express.js and connected the two with Axios.

It‚Äôs so rewarding to look back to just a month ago and see what I‚Äôm able to build now. Can‚Äôt wait for what‚Äôs coming.
